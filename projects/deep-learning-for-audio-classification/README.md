# Overview
The aim of this project is to build a model to classify recordings of 10 different instruments following the approach in the videos in order to gain intuition about working with audio files. Though, there are a few differences in the approach used to solve the classification problem.

# Data used
The training data used for building the model is part of the [Kaggle's Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging). Since the project is to feel more confident about working with audio files and learn more about the nature of sound waves, will use only 30 recordings for each of 10 distinct music instruments (n=300 samples). The filenames of the recordings in the training sample are stored in `instruments.csv`.
